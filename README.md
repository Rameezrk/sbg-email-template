# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Why I created this app

With the day to day runnings of my work I had to send daily emails to customers. However I kept running into the same problem on a daily basis which was that not all of the responses I had to send to the customer were templated in the program I used. 

This meant that over and over again I had to keep copy and pasting random information from word docs into the browser rather than just being able to select the correct template with the relevant information on and save time and energy doing a repeated chore. 

Therefore I decided to dive into solving the problem myself by creating the email templates from the get go and having an app that had all the necessary information on so that I could work on the more important parts of my job. 


## Lessons Learned

- Whilst I believe that my vanilla JS is quite strong getting it applied to React.JS has been difficult for me and I've spent some time being able to apply the skills that I have learned in a clean and effective way

- I've tried to keep the variable naming relevant but I have had difficulty producing clean code constantly going back and forth 


## What I would change

I initially thought that the easiest way to access the data would be through a JSON file and as an object but I've realised that with the amount of text required it has become quite cumbersome to manipulate the text. 

If I have the opportunity in the future I will create the email template text in a seperate JS file and add it in as a component. 

I also would then incorporate template literals so that the code is more efficient and easier to use and I need to have a system then where I can efficiently take in templates that are built by other users but this may be all outside of my scope for now.
